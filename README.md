A Discord bot that automatically notifies you about upcoming Call of Duty League (CDL) matches.

## Features

- 🔔 Automatic match notifications 15 minutes before start time
- 📅 Fetches schedules from CDL ICS feeds and official schedule page
- 🎯 Filter matches by specific teams (optional)
- 💾 Persistent storage using SQLite

- 🔄 Automatic schedule updates

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Discord Bot Token (see [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and configure:
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token
   - `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`: The channel ID where notifications will be sent
   - `TEAMS`: (Optional) Comma-separated team names to filter matches
   - Other settings as needed

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. View logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

3. Stop the bot:

## Configuring Team ICS Feeds

The bot needs team IDs to fetch match schedules from ICS feeds. You can configure this in two ways:

### Option 1: Using a File (Recommended)

Create a file named `ical_links.txt` (or set `TEAM_ICS_FILE` to a custom path) with the following format:

```
Team Name: webcal://cdl-public-archive.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CDL-calendar-sync/2026/team_id.ics
Another Team: https://cdl-public-archive.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CDL-calendar-sync/2026/team_id.ics
```

Example:
```
Texas OpTic: webcal://cdl-public-archive.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CDL-calendar-sync/2026/blt19237b20a0dd1b07.ics
Vegas FaZe: webcal://cdl-public-archive.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CDL-calendar-sync/2026/bltd84beef53d2aa9db.ics
```

**Why use a file?** Teams rebrand frequently, and maintaining a file makes it easy to update team names without changing environment variables. The bot will automatically extract team IDs from the URLs.

### Option 2: Using Environment Variable

Set the `TEAM_IDS` environment variable with comma-separated team IDs:

```bash
TEAM_IDS=blt19237b20a0dd1b07,bltd84beef53d2aa9db
```

### Finding Team ICS Feed URLs

CDL teams have individual ICS calendar feeds. The URL pattern is:
```
https://cdl-public-archive.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CDL-calendar-sync/2026/{team_id}.ics
```

To find a team's ICS feed:
1. Check the official CDL website for team calendar links
2. Look for `.ics` or calendar subscription links
3. The team ID is typically in the URL (e.g., `blt19237b20a0dd1b07`)

**Note:** Both methods can be used together - team IDs from the file and environment variable will be merged (duplicates are automatically removed).

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't send notifications

- Check that the bot has permission to send messages in the configured channel
- Verify the channel ID is correct (right-click channel → Copy ID)
- Check logs for errors

### No matches found

- **Check team ID configuration**: Ensure you have configured team IDs either via `ical_links.txt` file or `TEAM_IDS` environment variable
- Verify ICS feed URLs are accessible
- Check that team names in `TEAMS` match the actual team names in schedules
- Ensure the schedule page is accessible
- Check bot logs for specific error messages about missing team IDs

### Database errors

- Ensure the `data/` directory is writable
- Check disk space
- Try deleting `data/bot.db` to reset (will lose notification history)
